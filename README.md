# Flight-Delay-Prediction

## Notes
./data/bts_data.csv has all the bts data with all the features I think we should look at. Features that were not included include the ones that had many rows without values, ones that seemed repetitive like departure time vs departure time block, and ones that seem like cheating like flight arrival time.

./data/stock_data.csv has all the stock info

./data/all_data.csv is the stocks with the bts data. Something to note is that I think no weekends are there since there is no stock data for weekends and stuff like that.
